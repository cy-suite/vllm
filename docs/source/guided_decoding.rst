This example is based on the OpenAI beta wrapper over the `client.chat.completions.create()` method that provides richer integrations with Python specific types.

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI


class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str


class MathResponse(BaseModel):
    steps: List[Step]
    final_answer: str


client = OpenAI(base_url="http://0.0.0.0:8000/v1", api_key="dummy")
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful expert math tutor."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Solve 8x + 31 = 2."},
    ],
    response_format=MathResponse,
    extra_body=dict(guided_decoding_backend="outlines"),
)

message = completion.choices[0].message
print(message)
assert message.parsed
for i, step in enumerate(message.parsed.steps):
    print(f"Step #{i}:", step)
print("Answer:", message.parsed.final_answer)
```

Output:
```

Step #0: explanation="First, let's isolate the term with the variable 'x'. To do this, we'll subtract 31 from both sides of the equation." output='8x + 31 - 31 = 2 - 31'
Step #1: explanation='By subtracting 31 from both sides, we simplify the equation to 8x = -29.' output='8x = -29'
Step #2: explanation="Next, let's isolate 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 8." output='8x / 8 = -29 / 8'
Answer: x = -29/8
